## Testing

The following tests have been carried out to test the websites design and responsiveness along with tests to check the site meets accessibility needs aswell as its game logic and functionality.

### Design & responsiveness

### Accessibility 
**Test:** Image `alt` attributes.  
**Method:** Reviewed all card images and their alt attributes.  
**Result (Before):** `alt` tags were generic (`card-img`) and did not describe the images.  
**Action Taken:** Updated `alt` attributes to meaningful descriptions (e.g., "blue hexagon", "purple diamond").  
**Result (After):** Screen readers now announce descriptive image names.


**Test:** On page load a pop-up modal for "how to play" appears before the game begins.  
**Issue:** Creates a barrier between the user and the game. Users had no choice but to dismmiss the pop-up.  
**Action taken:** Update the Javascript to remove the function where the modal would show on page load or refresh.  
**Result:** Modal only shows when called with "how to play" button is clicked. 

### Javascript functionaility

**Test:** Click a card to see if flip function works.  
**Result (Before):** Front of card is shown with a `question mark` symbol.  
**Expected result:** Card flips on its vertical axis to reveal the image on the back side.  
**Result:** ‚úÖ Working (cards flip correctly).  


**Test:** Stop the same card from being clicked multiple times.  
**Result (Before):** Each card can be clicked unlimited times even when flipped.  
**Expected result:** Each card can only be clicked once, reflected in the message logged to the console.  
**Result:** ‚úÖ Working (console log messages show that the cards are only clicked once).


**Test:** Create a function that knows when 2 cards that are clicked, either match or don't match.  
**Result (Before):** Cards would flip but there was no logic behind what was flipped, the game did not know what to look for when matching cards and did not know how to deal with unmatched cards.  
**Expected result:** When 2 cards are flipped and they are unmatched, "shake" class should be added to them, after 1.2 seconds 2 classes should be removed from those cards being "shake" & "flip" restoring the cards back to their defualt state. Matched cards remain faced forwards with the correct console.log messages respectively.  
**Result:** ‚úÖ Working (console log messages show that cards have either been match or unmatched with correct classes being removed and addded).  
![game screenshot](assets/readme/cards-match.png) 
![game screenshot](assets/readme/cards-unmatch.png) "flip" class is removed in 1.2 seconds...

**Test:** Create timer function that starts on the first click and ends when all cards are matched.  
**Result (Before):** Timer is created but only starts the count once the first 2 cards are clicked rather than starting with the very first click of the game.  
**Fix:** Moved a section of code to the very top of the flipCard() function.  
**Result:** ‚úÖ Working as planned.
